# 🐛 Known Issues & Status

Last Updated: [Current Date]

## 🚨 Critical Issues (Priority 1)

### 1. Groups Authentication Flow
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress
**Description**: Groups can be created successfully, but subsequent API calls for group details, members, and messages return 401 unauthorized errors.

**Symptoms**:
- Group creation works (201 status)
- Redirect to group detail page fails
- API calls to `/api/groups/[id]/members`, `/api/groups/[id]/messages` return 401

**Root Cause**: Authentication tokens not being properly forwarded through Next.js proxy routes after environment variable changes.

**Debugging Info**:
```
✅ POST /api/groups 201 (group created)
❌ GET /api/groups/[id] 401 (no bearer token)
❌ GET /api/groups/[id]/members 401 (no bearer token)
❌ GET /api/groups/[id]/messages 401 (no bearer token)
```

**Files Involved**:
- `frontend/src/app/api/groups/[groupId]/route.ts`
- `frontend/src/app/api/groups/[groupId]/members/route.ts`
- `frontend/src/app/api/groups/[groupId]/messages/route.ts`
- `frontend/src/app/community/groups/[groupId]/client.tsx`

### 2. Military Support Chat Rooms
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress
**Description**: Anonymous chat rooms failing to load and connect properly.

**Symptoms**:
- "Join Anonymous Chat Rooms" button leads to empty/broken page
- WebSocket connections failing
- Chat room components throwing JavaScript errors

**Root Cause**: Missing API proxy routes and WebSocket connection configuration issues.

**Error Messages**:
```
❌ [anonymousMilitaryChatApi::getAnonymousRooms] {}
❌ WebSocket connection failed
```

**Files Involved**:
- `frontend/src/components/MilitarySupport/MilitaryChatRoom.tsx`
- `frontend/src/api/military-support/anonymousMilitaryChatApi.ts`
- `backend/src/api/routes/anonymous-military-chat.ts`

## ⚠️ Medium Issues (Priority 2)

### 3. Military Support API Endpoints
**Status**: 🔄 Partially Fixed
**Description**: Military support resources and disclaimer endpoints returning 500 errors.

**Symptoms**:
- Military support page shows resource cards but no data loads
- API calls to `/api/military-support/resources` return 500 status
- Disclaimer text not loading

**Recent Fix**: Added Next.js proxy routes, but backend endpoints may need work.

**Files Involved**:
- `frontend/src/app/api/military-support/resources/route.ts`
- `frontend/src/app/api/military-support/disclaimer/route.ts`
- `backend/src/api/controllers/militarySupportController.ts`

---

### 4. Dashboard Functionality
**Status**: ❌ Incomplete
**Description**: User dashboard missing core functionality.

**Missing Features**:
- Goals progress tracking
- Achievement displays
- Activity feed
- Statistics and charts

**Files Involved**:
- `frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/Dashboard/`

---

### 5. Goals Tracking System
**Status**: ❌ Incomplete
**Description**: Goals creation and tracking system not fully implemented.

**Missing Features**:

### 6. Admin Dashboard - Needs Implementation
**Status**: ❌ Not Configured
**Description**: Admin folder exists but lacks proper configuration and functionality.

**Issues**:
- Folder exists: `/src/app/admin-dashboard/`
- Missing: Role-based authentication, admin middleware, user role system
- No admin user creation process
- Should integrate with existing NextAuth setup

**Requirements**:
- Admin role in user schema
- Admin-specific middleware/guards
- Admin routes protection
- Admin user seeding/creation process

**Priority**: Medium (after auth fix)
**Estimated**: 1-2 days of developer time
